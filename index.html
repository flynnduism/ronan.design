        <p>I was born in <a class="hilite personal" href="https://dl3.pushbulletusercontent.com/oXwKRbg4t4TllrVHTZfwXOam9i8iNK4P/Screen%20Shot%202019-12-11%20at%202.49.19%20PM.png">Ireland in 1983</a>, and via a dial-up modem and a lot of photoshopped band posters, I found my way to being a designer of screen-based <a class="hilite oss" href="https://gist.github.com/flynnduism/4538d598abd956f22687">things</a>. I graduated from <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/courses/undergraduate/communications/multimedia.shtml">DCU</a> with a BSc in Multimedia in 2006 and spent my twenties working in <a class="hilite job" href="https://twitter.com/cloudsteph/status/1186897824396578816">digital design agencies</a> and startups in Dublin, before <a class="hilite personal" href="http://ronanandamiee.com/">moving to California</a> in 2013.</p>
        <p>Two cats and two kids later, I live in Point Richmond CA. I've spent about sixteen years working across interaction, UX, branding, marketing, and product design roles, and more recently as <a class="hilite job" href="https://deislabs.io">an engineer</a> working in <a class="hilite job" href="https://helm.sh/">open source tech</a>.
        <p>Now I'm part of Fermyon Technologies &mdash; a mysterious new entity.</p>
